# Student-Management-System

### The Student Management System is a web-based application developed using Python and Django to manage student records efficiently. The project allows administrators to add, view, update, and delete student details through a secure login system.

#### The system includes course selection functionality, where predefined courses such as Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Cyber Security, AWS, SAP, and Java Full Stack are available. Based on the selected course, the system automatically displays the course fee and duration.

#### An admin dashboard is implemented to monitor student information and track attendance data. The dashboard integrates API-based logic to calculate and display student attendance over a 365-day period, providing a clear overview of academic participation.

#### All student details, course information, and attendance records are stored securely in a relational database using Django ORM. The project follows proper MVC architecture, ensuring clean code structure and maintainability.

#### This project demonstrates skills in backend development, database management, authentication handling, CRUD operations, and dashboard implementation using Django.
